# Gerrymandering-Viz
## Overview
The Gerrymandering program is a Python application designed to simulate the division of a grid into electoral districts. It demonstrates key principles like equal population, contiguity, and compactness in district creation. The program uses the Tkinter library for graphical representation and allows users to visualize how different numbers of districts can be mapped on a grid. (Basic trials and still modifying it⛽️)

## Features
- **Grid Division**: Divides a grid into a specified number of districts.
- **Random Color Assignment**: Assigns colors (light red and light blue) to each cell in the grid randomly, representing different political affiliations.
- **District Visualization**: Clearly delineates district boundaries with yellow lines.
- **Adherence to Principles**: Follows the principles of equal population, contiguity, and compactness in district creation.
